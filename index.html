<h1>Noah Daniels</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Noah Daniels, so whats up. I attend zoom university for CSULB and I have a serious case of procrastination. I will do all the work, but always last minute because of my terrible habits. I do have some good qualities thought. Some people think I am funny and some think I am nice but others think I am annoying or a jerk. From what I have observed here, this is kind of the case ofr everybody in that, we all have haters. Despite these things I also love a lot of different things</p>
